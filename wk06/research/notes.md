### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
Yesterday to add a new assignment.

**Observations**: [What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
It was very easy and fast but it was quite a basic app, was lacking undo and editing features

**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
'Basic' 'Undo' 'Editing'
---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: [Quote]

Irritating when making a spelling mistake and having to delete and remake a task rather than undoing and editing the task
**Observations**:
It could be quite a common problem with people making mistakes as their device could not have autocorrect and also people with disabilities such as dyslexia

**Themes**:
'Spelling Mistakes' 'Undo' 'Delete'

## Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
I had a worksheet due and it was also during a very busy time and unfortunately it was buried among other tasks

**Observations**: 
It was quite an annoying feature as I needed the system and was dependant on it for my exams
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
'Lack of organisation' 'Priority'

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**: [Quote]
Sometimes when I am on the train I do work without the mouse but it doesnt really affect how I use most of the apps as I can use the trackpad and if not I can use tab and shortcuts to help me get by which is fortunately a standard for most websites

**Observations**:
Most websites do support tabbing and shortcuts however it does become very difficult when they arent standardised.
**Themes**:
'Tabbing' 'Shortcuts'

## Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
I have never used it with my eyes closed but tried to use it on holiday at the beach and it was tough working through the glare and would be quite useful to have a dark mode to help me get through it.

**Observations**:
It is dependant on whether the app has support for a dark mode or a reduced light mode with reduced contrast

**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
'Contrast' 'Reduced Glare'

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: [Quote]
It would definitely be to edit tasks and a priority system and have certain tags on each of the tasks 

**Observations**:
An editing system needs to be there to create a task with a smoother workflow
**Themes**:
'Edititing' 'Priority'


## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
Top pain points:

Inability to edit or undo tasks

Participant frequently makes spelling mistakes and is forced to delete and recreate tasks instead of editing them.

This breaks workflow, increases frustration, and is especially problematic for users without autocorrect or with dyslexia.

Tasks getting lost due to poor organisation or prioritisation

Important tasks (e.g., an exam worksheet) became buried during busy periods.

Lack of clear priority indicators or grouping makes the system unreliable when it’s needed most.

Difficulty using the app in bright environments

Glare at the beach made the app hard to read.

Dark mode or reduced-contrast mode would make usage easier in bright light.

Inconsistent keyboard accessibility when not using a mouse

Participant relies on tabbing and shortcuts, which vary across apps.

Non-standard navigation patterns make keyboard-only use harder.

**Job story ideas**:
- "When [situation], I want [motivation] so [outcome]."

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
3 days ago.
**Observations**: [What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
It was easy once you get to know it but getting to grips with it is challenging as there can be lots of information

**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
'Learning Curve' 'Overwhelming information'

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: [Quote]
When there is too many tasks there is not a nice format for you too see them all and it becomes intimidating and you become less productive

[Repeat for Q3-Q6]


## Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
When you have a really long tasks list which leads to you  forgetting about tasks and forgetting them completely
**Observations**: 
Long list leads to task blindness and memory loss
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
---
'Task overload' 'Task tracking'

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**: [Quote]
Not really but sometimes I bay use the arrows to navigate the feature which doesnr impact how I work too much but does make it more tedious rather than using a mouse
**Observations**:
Keyboard navigation slower but not a major issue
**Themes**:
'Keyboard navigation' 'Productivity'

## Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
I wouldnt say with my eyes closed but using it in bright sunlight does make it harder to work, so I wouldnt use it in birght sunlight or in bright rooms
**Observations**:
A dark mode to reduce glare is significantly relevant.
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
---
'Brightness issues' 'Visibility'

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: [Quote]
A feature that takes into account focus and energy level and isolates priorities so it doesnt overwhelm me but I am still productive
**Observations**:
Indicates need for intelligent filtering or mode switching.
**Themes**:
'Focus' 'Adaptive Prioritisation'

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1.Top Pain Points

Overwhelming, cluttered task lists

Too much information at once → intimidation + reduced productivity.

Lack of clear organisation or filtering

Hard to track tasks when lists grow long → task blindness.

Poor visibility in bright environments

Avoids using the app in strong light.

Keyboard navigation feels tedious

Not broken, but inefficient → could benefit from better shortcuts or focus mode.

**Context**: [e.g., Uses keyboard only, ADHD, prefers dark mode]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
I used it just yesterday morning when I had to organize my day’s tasks.
**Observations**: [What stood out? Frustration? Workaround?]
Felt rushed, had to switch between tasks a lot, and the interface didn’t help with prioritizing. It felt like a bit of a struggle to stay on track.
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
'Time pressure' 'Prioritisation Struggles'
---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: [Quote]
The notifications are all over the place, and there’s no way to set a proper reminder for each task. So, I forget half of them
**Observations**:
The lack of clear notification management leads to important tasks slipping through the cracks. More personalized reminder settings would help.
**Themes**:
'Notification Management' 'Task Reminders' 'Forgetfulness'

[Repeat for Q3-Q6]


## Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
Yes, that happens a lot. Sometimes a task just gets buried in the list, and I forget about it, especially if it’s a small task.
**Observations**: 
The interface is cluttered, and without a visual cue, it’s easy to miss smaller, less urgent tasks.
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
'Task Burial' 'Overloaded UI'

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**: [Quote]
Yes, I’ve had to use keyboard shortcuts a lot when I'm on the go, but it makes navigating more complicated. It’s fine for basic things, but harder to organize or move things around.
**Observations**:
Keyboard shortcuts are useful but not efficient enough for a smooth workflow when organizing tasks in complex apps.
**Themes**:
'Keyboard Shortcuts' 'Navigation Efficiency'

## Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**: [Quote or paraphrase]
In bright sunlight, it’s pretty difficult to read anything on the screen, so I usually avoid using it then. I’ve never tried with my eyes closed, but I imagine the app’s design wouldn’t make it easy.
**Observations**:
Bright light creates visibility issues, and the lack of any adaptive features to adjust to lighting conditions is an obstacle.
**Themes**: `[tag1]`, `[tag2]`
---
'Visibility Issues' 'Lighting Adaptability'

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: [Quote]
A way to automatically categorize tasks by importance, urgency, and effort level would help a lot. That way I wouldn’t have to manually assess each one.**Observations**:
Indicates a need for smarter, context-aware task management that prioritizes based on user preferences and work patterns.
**Themes**:
'Task Categorization' 'Automated Prioritization'
## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1.Top Pain Points

Disorganized notifications

Task notifications are not well-managed, making it easy to forget important tasks.

Task burial in cluttered interface

Smaller tasks get lost in a long, crowded list without clear visual cues, leading to lost or forgotten tasks.

Visibility issues in bright environments

The app becomes nearly unreadable in bright light, creating unnecessary barriers to task management.

Limited keyboard navigation

Keyboard-only navigation is cumbersome, especially when trying to manage or organize tasks.
