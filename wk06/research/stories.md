# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

Story S1: Editable Tasks & Undo

Situation: When I make a typo or need to change a detail in a task
Motivation: I want to quickly edit or undo without deleting and recreating the task
Outcome: So I can keep my workflow smooth and avoid losing information
Underlying need: Because rewriting tasks is frustrating, slow, and disproportionately harder for users with dyslexia or without autocorrect

Evidence: Participant A (notes L5–L10), Participant C (task burial + workflow strain)
Inclusion risk: Cognitive, Motor, Low digital literacy
Type: Job story
WCAG: 3.3.3 Error Suggestion (AA), 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)

Story S2: Confirmation Feedback

Situation: When I submit a form (add/edit/delete task)
Motivation: I want immediate, explicit confirmation that the action succeeded
Outcome: So I can trust the interface without refreshing to verify
Underlying need: Because uncertainty about save status causes anxiety and inefficient workarounds

Evidence: Participant A (workflow disruptions), Participant B (overload → uncertainty)
Inclusion risk: Cognitive, Screen reader, Low digital literacy
Type: Job story
WCAG: 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)

Story S3: Prioritisation & Reducing Task Overload

Situation: When my task list grows long and cluttered
Motivation: I want clear prioritisation, grouping, or automatic categorisation
Outcome: So I can avoid task blindness and focus on what matters first
Underlying need: Because overloaded lists become overwhelming and lead to forgotten or buried tasks

Evidence: Participant A (worksheet buried), Participant B (intimidating long lists), Participant C (small tasks buried)
Inclusion risk: ADHD, Cognitive load, Anxiety
Type: Job story
WCAG: 1.3.1 Info & Relationships (A)

Story S4: Keyboard-Friendly Navigation

Situation: When I’m working on the train or without a mouse
Motivation: I want consistent, efficient keyboard navigation and shortcuts
Outcome: So I can move, organise, and review tasks without unnecessary steps
Underlying need: Because inconsistent keyboard support slows users down and creates barriers to basic task management

Evidence: Participant A (tab + shortcuts), Participant B (tedious arrows), Participant C (keyboard fine for basics but not organising)
Inclusion risk: Motor, Screen reader, Low-vision users
Type: Job story
WCAG: 2.1.1 Keyboard (A), 2.4.7 Focus Visible (AA)

Story S5: Visibility in Bright Environments

Situation: When I’m using the app outdoors or in bright sunlight
Motivation: I want a mode that increases readability (dark mode / high contrast / reduced glare)
Outcome: So I can still see and manage tasks without eye strain or guesswork
Underlying need: Because glare washes out text and makes the interface unusable in common, unavoidable lighting situations

Evidence: Participant A (beach glare), Participant B (avoids bright rooms), Participant C (hard to read in sunlight)
Inclusion risk: Low vision, Photosensitivity, Older adults
Type: Job story
WCAG: 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum (AA), 1.4.10 Reflow (AA)
